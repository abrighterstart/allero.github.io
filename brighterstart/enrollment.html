    State guidelines:
    “Child Enrollment and Health Information must be completed and given to the provider before care is provided for any child. A medical statement, indicating that your child has been examined by a health care professional, must be signed and submitted the day of the child’s first day of care. Your child must be examined at least once every 13 months and medical statement completed, until your child enters a grade of Kindergarten or above. Each year, this enrollment information must be reviewed and the form must be signed again verifying that the information is accurate. Anytime there is a change to this information, you should inform the provider immediately to assure that current information is always on file.
    Ours guidelines: At A Brighter Start, we ask that you provide your child’s medical information before your child/children are enrolled.
    All new children will be cared for on a two-week (14 calendar day) trial period beginning on your child’s first actual day of care. During that time the parent or provider may terminate the childcare agreement with 24 hr. notice. No pre-paid fees will be credited upon cancellation during the trial period. After the trial period, a two-week notice is required by either party to terminate the childcare agreement. (See Withdrawal Policy)</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">Dress Code</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">Please dress your child appropriately. The activities may be messy. Do not send your child in clothing that you do not want stained.
    Weather permitting: we will spend a lot of time outdoors. You also need to supply a complete change of clothing in case of an accident; we do not supply clothing for daycare children.
    If the child/children have no spare clothing, the parent will be called from work/school and be expected to bring a clean change of clothing or the parent will be expected to have someone pick up the child up from our care. Please do not send your children with open toe shoes on, if they arrive with in sandals that aren’t closed toe, they will not be permitted to play outdoors for that day.
