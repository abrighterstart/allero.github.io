<h1 style="text-align:center">Field Trips</h1>
<p style="text-align:center">Parents/Guardians, we will have monthly field trips that are very affordable, <br>
    with the exception of the summer time the field trips are bi-weekly.We expect all children to attend.<br>
     We only choose locations that are nice to our pockets and best of all; we are paying half so, <br>
     please financially plan on your child/children attending.</p> 

<h1 style="text-align:center">Transportation</h1>     

<p style="text-align:center">Parents/Guardians, feel comfortable knowing that when we begin to provide transportation <br>
    all drivers that are employed here must have a safe driving record. Also, it may provide you with more comfort<br>
     knowing that the ODJFS require that all vehicles used for the purposes of transporting children are inspected<br>
      weekly by our staff and annual safety inspected by an ASE Certified Mechanic. All drivers are also required<br>
       to complete transportation safety and training by The Ohio State Highway Patrol. Written permission must<br>
        be secured from the caretaker prior to leaving the premises. The “Child Enrollment & Health Information”<br>
         form will be taken for each child, as well as a complete first aid kit, a roster with all children listed,<br>
          a working cellphone and health records information for any child who may need care. Children will never<br>
           be left unsupervised and smoking shall not occur in any vehicle while children are present. <br>
           Until we are able to purchase a van large enough to hold a group of 12 we would have no other choice <br>
           but to transport the children in groups of 6 on outings. Currently, we do not provide transportation.<br>
             If we have parents as volunteers to help drive and help provide supervision would could possible travel<br>
              as a groups.
